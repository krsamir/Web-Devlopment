Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class
#id
*
element---> normal selector.
element1, element2 ---> selecting both the elements individually.
element1 element2 ---> selecting the element2 inside the element1 tag.
element1 > element2 --->selecting the element2 where element1 is the direct parent.
element1 + element2 --->selecting the element2 that is right after the element1 tag.
:hover --->transition between the hovered element and the non hovered element,
            there are many such options for transitions like active etc..
:last-child--> applies the attributes only to the last child of the particular tag,
                for example a <div> tag has many tags of <p>,in this case only the last child as in the last <p> tag attains the attributes allotted to the <div> tag. 
:first-child--> same as the last-child selector but applies to the first child only
!important (not recommended)----> changes the tag to top priority no matter what the tag holds.


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
